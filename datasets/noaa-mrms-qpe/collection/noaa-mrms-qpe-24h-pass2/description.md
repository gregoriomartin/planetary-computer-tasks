The [Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE)](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/mrms/) products are seamless 1-km mosaics of precipitation accumulation covering the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, the Caribbean, and Guam. The products are automatically generated through integration of data from multiple radars and radar networks, surface and satellite observations, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and climatology. The products are updated hourly at the top of the hour.

MRMS QPE is available as a "Pass 1" or "Pass 2" product. The Pass 1 product is available with a 60-minute latency and includes 60-65% of gauges. The Pass 2 product has a higher latency of 120 minutes, but includes 99% of gauges. The Pass 1 and Pass 2 products are broken into 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 48-, and 72-hour accumulation sub-products.

This Collection contains the **24-Hour Pass 2** sub-product, i.e., 24-hour cumulative precipitation accumulation with a 2-hour latency. The data are available in [Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/) format as well as the original source GRIB2 format files. The GRIB2 files are delivered to Azure as part of the [NOAA Open Data Dissemination (NODD) Program](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/open-data-dissemination).
